    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "Database :-A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for \n",
    "efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. Databases are used to store and manage \n",
    "data for a wide range of applications, from simple address books to complex enterprise systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between SQL and NoSQL :-\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases :\n",
    "1.Structured Data: SQL databases are designed for structured data with well-defined schemas.\n",
    "Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and each column has a specific data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.ACID Transactions: SQL databases adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) \n",
    "properties, which ensure data integrity and reliability. Transactions are either fully completed \n",
    "or fully rolled back in case of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Relational: SQL databases are often referred to as relational databases because they support \n",
    "relationships between tables through foreign keys. This enables the creation of complex queries \n",
    "and joins to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Scalability: SQL databases typically follow a vertical scaling model, where you increase the\n",
    "power of a single server (vertical scaling) to handle more data and traffic. This can be\n",
    "cost-prohibitive for large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases :\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Unstructured or Semi-structured Data: NoSQL databases are designed to handle a variety\n",
    "of data types, including unstructured and semi-structured data. They do not enforce a\n",
    "strict schema, allowing for more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.BASE Transactions: NoSQL databases often use the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state,\n",
    "Eventually consistent) model, which sacrifices some of the ACID properties in favor of \n",
    "improved availability and scalability. Data consistency may be eventual rather than immediate. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.Non-Relational: NoSQL databases are non-relational, meaning they don't use tables with \n",
    "fixed schemas. They can use various data models, including document-oriented, key-value,\n",
    "column-family, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Scalability: NoSQL databases typically follow a horizontal scaling model, where you add\n",
    "more commodity servers to handle increasing data and traffic. This allows for better \n",
    "scalability and cost-effectiveness for large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Examples: MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (column-family), Redis (key-value), \n",
    "Neo4j (graph), Amazon DynamoDB (key-value and document).                                                         "

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "DDL:- DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language)\n",
    "used to define, manage, and manipulate the structure of a database. DDL statements are used \n",
    "to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. \n",
    "These statements do not deal with the actual data stored in the database but rather focus \n",
    "on the structure and organization of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, \n",
    "indexes, and views. It defines the structure of the object, including its columns, \n",
    "data types, constraints, and other properties.\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    hire_date DATE\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a new table named \"employees\" is created with columns for employee information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views, \n",
    "and all the data associated with them. This action is irreversible, and it permanently removes \n",
    "the object from the database.\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will delete the \"employees\" table and all its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database \n",
    "object, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns, constraints, or indexes.\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement adds a new \"email\" column to the existing \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while \n",
    "retaining the table structure. Unlike the DROP statement, TRUNCATE does not \n",
    "delete the table itself; it only removes the rows of data within it.\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will remove all records from the \"employees\" table, but the table structure remains intact."

    "Example :\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET first_name = 'Jane'\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "Ans :-\n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in relational databases that define\n",
    "relationships between tables and ensure data integrity. They serve distinct purposes:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Uniqueness: A primary key is a column (or a set of columns) in a table that uniquely \n",
    "identifies each row in that table. It enforces the uniqueness constraint, meaning \n",
    "that no two rows in the table can have the same values in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Uniqueness and Not Null: In addition to uniqueness, a primary key column cannot \n",
    "contain NULL values. Every row must have a valid, non-null value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Data Integrity: The primary key is used to establish data integrity and ensure that \n",
    "each row can be uniquely identified. It enables efficient data retrieval and indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Example: In a \"Students\" table, a \"student_id\" column can be designated as the primary key. \n",
    "Each student will have a unique \"student_id,\" and this key helps in identifying and \n",
    "referencing individual students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Relationships: A foreign key is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that \n",
    "establishes a link between the data in two tables. It creates a relationship between \n",
    "the table containing the foreign key and another table (usually the table with the \n",
    "corresponding primary key).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Referential Integrity: The foreign key enforces referential integrity by ensuring \n",
    "that values in the foreign key column(s) match values in the primary key column(s) \n",
    "of the referenced table. This means that the data in the foreign key column(s) must \n",
    "exist in the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cascading Actions: You can specify actions that should occur when a record in \n",
    "the referenced table is modified or deleted. These actions include \n",
    "CASCADE (changes propagate to related rows), SET NULL (foreign key values set to NULL),\n",
    "SET DEFAULT, and NO ACTION (no action allowed if related data exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Example: In a database with \"Students\" and \"Courses\" tables, the \"student_id\" column\n",
    "in the \"Courses\" table can be a foreign key that references the \"student_id\" primary \n",
    "key in the \"Students\" table. This establishes a relationship between students and the \n",
    "courses they are enrolled in."

    "Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "In an SQL query, the clauses are typically executed in a specific order, and understanding this order is \n",
    "important for constructing valid and efficient SQL statements. The general order of execution for SQL \n",
    "clauses in a SELECT statement is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.FROM: The FROM clause specifies the table or tables from which data should be retrieved. It identifies \n",
    "the source tables for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.WHERE: The WHERE clause filters the rows from the tables specified in the FROM clause. It is used \n",
    "to apply conditions to the data to determine which rows should be included in the result set. Rows \n",
    "that do not meet the specified conditions are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used for grouping rows with similar values in specified columns. \n",
    "This clause is typically used with aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT, AVG) to perform \n",
    "calculations on groups of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter the groups created by the GROUP BY clause based on conditions. \n",
    "It acts as a filter for grouped data, similar to the WHERE clause for individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.SELECT: The SELECT clause determines which columns from the tables should be included in the result set. \n",
    "It specifies the data to be retrieved and presented in the output.\n",

    "6.DISTINCT: The DISTINCT keyword, if used, eliminates duplicate rows from the result set based on the \n",
    "columns specified in the SELECT clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It \n",
    "specifies the order in which the rows should be displayed in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.LIMIT/OFFSET (optional): The LIMIT clause (or LIMIT/OFFSET combination) is used to restrict the\n",
    "number of rows returned in the result set, while OFFSET can be used to skip a certain number of rows. \n",
    "These clauses are often used for pagination or limiting the result set size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9.UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT (optional): If your query includes set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, \n",
    "or EXCEPT, these are applied after the individual SELECT statements are executed."
